4450 Parser Project

Hi, I'm Ethan Lai. This is my submission for the 4450 parser project.
This one's a solo affair, no teammates.
There are no real requirements. If you've followed the guide on Canvas,
it should work. I used ANTLR 4.13.2 though.

# How to Use

Just go to your command prompt and type in 'python driver.py [filename]'.
[filename] will be whatever file you're testing.

Please see the Canvas submission for the video demo.
